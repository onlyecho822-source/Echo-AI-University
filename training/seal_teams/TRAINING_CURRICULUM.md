## Total Training Pipeline

**Current Enrollment:** 136 operators (34 teams × 4 members)  
**Training Duration:** 90 days  
**Expected Graduation:** April 9, 2026  
**Deployment Target:** Echo Universe (production)

## Phoenix Cycle Integration

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Universe failures → Phoenix analysis → University curriculum updates
- Real production chaos → Training scenarios
- Certified operators → Field experience → Training refinements

**The Loop:**
1. Operators train in University (controlled chaos)
2. Operators deploy to Universe (real chaos)
3. Phoenix extracts lessons from Universe failures
4. Phoenix updates University training scenarios
5. Next cohort trains with improved curriculum

**This is why the architecture is unrepeatable:**
- Training evolves based on production reality
- No static curriculum
- Continuous adaptation
- Institutional memory

## Instructor Notes

**Training Philosophy:**
- Fail fast in University (safe)
- Succeed always in Universe (production)
- 100% pass rate required
- No shortcuts
- No exceptions

**The Truth:**
- University gives you certification (you are ready)
- Universe gives you scars (you are worthy)
- Both are required
- Neither is optional
